## Lab01, Instructions

In this practical assignment, you are to add your responses to the questions in blue of the lab. Your reflection should be about a page and contain clear and meaningful language. Please use markdown language to format your reflection piece.

Please write below this line to address the above-mentioned points. Replace the word, `TODO` with your response.

### First Tool: Cutadapt

 1. What kind of research is this method or tool used for?
 This tool is used in metagenomics.

 2. How does this method or tool work? What does it do?
 Cutadapt removes unwanted/unnecessary data from a sequence, such as adapter sequences or primers.

 3. Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?
 This tool was likely necessary to clean out "junk" data, so that other tools are able to process only the important parts.

 4. What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method of tool?
 If the tool is misused, you might remove data that should be kept.

### Second Tool: MaSuRCA

 1. What kind of research is this method or tool used for?
 MaSuRCA is used in whole-genome sequencing.

 2. How does this method or tool work? What does it do?
 This tool is a genome assembler, it uses a new technique utilizing de Bruijn graphs and "super-reads" to assemble a genome more quickly and efficiently.

 3. Why do you think that this method or tool was necessary to develop?
 This tool was necessary to develop to improve previously slow or inefficient methods of assembling genomes, allowing for more work to be done with less computing power.

 4. What undesirable consequences could result from the misuse of this method of tool?
 This tool might make mistakes in assembling a genome if used improperly due to the specifics of its methods, particularly if the input is not quality-controlled.
